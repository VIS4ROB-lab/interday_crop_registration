# dataset
This folder contains the crop dataset used to train LoFTR and do the crop registration task.
The scripts are used to generate necessary files befor training LoFTR.

## File structure
*Note: The datasets here do not contain original images, generated depth images. Please [download](../README.md#downloads) thems eperately. The code will use the images and depth images by their absolute paths, and sometimes create symbolic links to them.


* `crops`
    * `train`: Dates from 2018 used to [train LoFTR](../LoFTR/README.md)
    * `Wheat_2019`: Experiment V.B in the paper
    * `exp_pipeline`: Experiment V.C in the paper
* `crop_indices`: Indices necessary to train LoFTR. Generated by [`generate_indices.py`](./generate_indices.py). Here what we present is only an example. Remember to **generate a new one** with your own path of the downloaded dataset.
*  [`generate_indices.py`](./generate_indices.py): Script to generate `crop_indices`. Refer to [here](../LoFTR/README.md#how-to-train) for its susage.
